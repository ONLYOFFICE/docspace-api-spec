`GET /api/2.0/migration/list`

Get available migrators

Lists the source products this installation can import a portal from, as the migrator names every other  operation in this group expects. Nothing has to be called first, a DocSpace administrator is required as  everywhere here, and the call is read-only and idempotent. The answer is a plain list of names such as  &#x60;GoogleWorkspace&#x60;, &#x60;Nextcloud&#x60; or &#x60;Workspace&#x60;, never localized and ordered as the migrators are registered;  pass one of them as &#x60;migratorName&#x60; to &#x60;POST api/2.0/migration/init/{migratorName}&#x60;, where the match ignores  case. The list depends on the installation rather than on the portal, so it does not change while the portal  runs, and a name that is not in it is not rejected by the operation that takes it - the queued job ends with  the failure reported in &#x60;error&#x60; of &#x60;GET api/2.0/migration/status&#x60;.
