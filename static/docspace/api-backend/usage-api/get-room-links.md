`GET /api/2.0/files/rooms/{id}/links`

Get the room links

Returns the sharing links of a room, with the invitation and the external links mixed together unless &#x60;type&#x60;  narrows it to one kind. Each entry carries the link address, its title, access level, expiration, the flag  that marks the primary external link of the room and, for invitation links, how many times it may still be  used. Public and form filling rooms come with an external link created for them, so an empty answer there  means that the link was revoked rather than that the room is private; rooms of the other kinds start with no  links at all and only gain one when somebody creates it, which for a collaboration room and a virtual data  room can be an invitation link alone. The caller needs access to the room and the right to see its links: a  member invited without that right gets an empty list rather than an error, while somebody who is not in the  room at all is refused. Paging parameters are not honoured here: the first hundred links are returned and the  reported count is the number of entries actually sent.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **id** | path | **Integer** (int32) | The room whose links are listed, named by the identifier that &#x60;GET api/2.0/files/rooms&#x60; reports for it. | [required] [example: 1] |
| **type** | query | **LinkType** | Narrows the answer to one kind of link: invitation links, which turn whoever opens them into a member, or  external links, which open the room without an account. Leaving it out returns both kinds together. | [optional] [example: 1] [enum: 0, 1] |
