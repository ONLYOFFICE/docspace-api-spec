`POST /api/2.0/migration/cancel`

Cancel migration

Stops the parse pass queued for this portal and deletes the backup uploaded for it - the way back from a wrong  archive or a wrong migrator name. Nothing has to be called first and a DocSpace administrator is required; the  request is only queued, so the parse ends shortly after the call returns and  &#x60;GET api/2.0/migration/status&#x60; stops reporting it. The call is destructive for the uploaded data: the whole  upload folder is removed and the backup has to be sent to &#x60;migrationFileUpload.ashx&#x60; again before a new parse.  It is idempotent - cancelling when nothing is running still answers 200 - and it undoes nothing that was  already written to the portal. Only the parse stage is stopped, the job whose &#x60;parseResult.operation&#x60; is  &#x60;parse&#x60;: an import started by &#x60;POST api/2.0/migration/migrate&#x60; keeps running, and a finished import is  discarded with &#x60;POST api/2.0/migration/clear&#x60; instead.
