`GET /api/2.0/ai/profiles/list`

List provider profiles

Lists the portal&#39;s AI provider profiles with their secrets stripped, the same way the single-profile read does. It takes no parameters and is not paginated, because a portal holds few profiles. On a portal running the AI gateway the answer is synthesised from the gateway&#39;s own catalogue rather than from stored records. The IDs in the answer are what the assignment operations and every round&#39;s &#x60;profileId&#x60; accept.

## Parameters
This endpoint does not need any parameter.
