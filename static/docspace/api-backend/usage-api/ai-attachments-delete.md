`DELETE /api/2.0/ai/attachments/delete`

Delete one attachment

Permanently deletes one attachment, whether it is still a draft or already bound to a message. The ID is not validated here, so a malformed one surfaces as an error relayed from storage rather than as a 400, and an ID that does not exist answers success without deleting anything. Deleting a bound attachment leaves the message in place without it. The deletion cannot be undone.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **body** | body | **String** | The ID of the attachment to delete, as a bare JSON string. | [required] |
